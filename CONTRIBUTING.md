# Contributing to the Government of Ireland Design System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Government of Ireland Design System.

This repository is publicly available, but it is governed and maintained by the **Government of Ireland**. Contributions are welcome, but acceptance is at the discretion of the maintainers.

## What this repository is for

This design system exists to:
- support consistent, accessible government services
- document patterns and components used by official Irish government services
- enable reuse within the public sector

**It is not a general-purpose UI library, and it is not a branding toolkit for non-government use.**

## How contributions work

This repository welcomes collaboration through discussion, problem reporting,
and evidence-based proposals.

Contributions help inform and improve the design system, while implementation
and release decisions remain with the designated maintainers.

The most effective way to contribute is by clearly describing problems,
sharing context, and providing examples from real government services.

## Starting a discussion

**[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/discussions)** are used to explore ideas, questions, and observations.

Discussions are useful when you want to:
- ask whether a pattern or component already exists
- share feedback or research findings
- explore potential improvements before a concrete problem is identified
- understand how the design system is intended to be used in specific contexts

A discussion does not need to be a fully formed proposal.
Clear descriptions, examples, or references are usually enough to start a useful conversation.

## Raising an issue

If you encounter a specific problem, gap, or defect, please open a **[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/issues)**.

Issues are used to:
- report bugs or unexpected behaviour
- document accessibility or compliance problems
- describe missing guidance or unclear documentation
- track agreed improvements to existing components or patterns

When opening an issue, focus on:
- what the problem is
- who is affected
- why it matters for government services

Issues should focus on describing the problem and its impact rather than proposing a specific solution.

## Pull requests

Pull requests may be used to support an issue with concrete examples or demonstrations.

For example, a pull request can:
- illustrate a proposed solution
- demonstrate an accessibility issue or improvement
- provide a reference implementation to support discussion

Pull requests are typically created **in relation to an existing issue**.
They may be reviewed as part of the discussion and are not guaranteed to be merged.

Final implementation and release decisions remain with the maintainers.
External pull requests are accepted under the current contribution policy and
may be closed once the issue has been sufficiently demonstrated or reviewed.

## Design contributions and Figma

This repository includes a **public [Figma Design](packages/design/figma/README.md) file** that supports the Government of Ireland Design System.

The Figma file can be downloaded and installed locally.
It is intended to support exploration, testing, and discussion of design patterns
used in government services.

If you would like to propose a design-related change, you can:
- download the Figma file
- explore or modify existing components or patterns
- share your proposed changes as part of a **[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/discussions)**

Design proposals can include screenshots, links, or uploaded Figma files demonstrating the proposed changes.
Design discussions should focus on the problem being addressed and its context, rather than on visual preference alone.

## What kind of input is welcome

We welcome input that helps improve the design system, including:
- bug reports and reproducible issues
- accessibility findings or audit results
- documentation gaps or unclear guidance
- references to published standards (for example, WCAG)
- evidence-based proposals grounded in real government service needs

All contributions should:
- improve clarity, accessibility, or consistency
- align with existing design principles
- include context, rationale, or supporting evidence
- be compatible with public-sector constraints

## What we do not accept

We generally do not accept:
- direct implementation of pull requests from external contributors
- new components without a demonstrated government use case
- proposals that duplicate existing patterns
- changes driven solely by aesthetics or trends
- branding changes or new logos
- features that imply endorsement of non-government services

## Expectations

- Be respectful and constructive
- Be prepared for requests to revise or withdraw proposals
- Understand that not all contributions will be accepted

Thank you for helping improve government services.

## Fraud, branding, and impersonation

The Government of Ireland Design System is open source, but:

- Only official Irish government services may use:
    - government logos, crests, or wordmarks
    - official domain names (e.g. `.gov.ie`)
- Reuse of this design system does not confer endorsement
- Use of these materials to impersonate government services is unlawful

See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for further details.
