# Foundations

The foundation is the backbone of the design system, encompassing essential aspects like colour, typography, iconography, spacing, and layout. These elements collectively shape the digital brand and serve as the building blocks for all user interactions, ensuring a cohesive and accessible user experience.

These elements are stored as design tokens, which can be easily managed and used. They ensure that designs remain uniform and scalable. The tokens enable seamless updates and maintenance, keeping user interfaces consistent and reliable.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of the design system. The guidelines follow the principles of universal design, ensuring that digital services are inclusive and accessible to everyone. This includes considerations for colour contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and more. Prioritising accessibility upholds the responsibility to serve every member of the community.

By adhering to these foundational principles, including styles such as colour, typography, and spacing, digital experiences are created that are consistent, accessible, and user-friendly. These guidelines help in building products that meet high standards and effectively serve the needs of all users.
