# Layout

## Screen size

Design for small screens first, starting with a single-column layout.

For most types of page, we recommend using either a ‘two-thirds’ or a ‘two-thirds and one-third’ layout. That stops lines of text getting so long that the page becomes difficult to read on desktop devices. This would usually mean no more than 75 characters per line.

Never make assumptions about what devices people are using. Design for different screen sizes rather than specific devices.

## Common layouts

### Two-thirds

<TwoThirds>This is a test content</TwoThirds>

```html
<div className="gi-layout-container-3-column">
    <div className="gi-layout-column-2-3">left content</div>
</div>
```

### Two-thirds and one-third

<TwoThirdsOneThird 
    left={
        <>This is a test content</>
    }
    right={
        <>This is a side content</>
    } />

```html
<div className="gi-layout-container-3-column">
    <div className="gi-layout-column-2-3">left content</div>
    <div className="gi-layout-column-1-3">right content</div>
</div>
```

## Setting up page wrappers

If you want to build your layout from scratch, or understand what each of the parts are responsible for, here’s an explanation of how the page wrappers work.

### Limiting width of content

To set up your layout you will need to create 2 wrappers. The first should have the class `gi-layout-container`, which sets the maximum width of the content but does not add any vertical margin or padding.

If your design requires them, you should place components such as breadcrumbs, back link and phase banner inside this wrapper so that they sit directly underneath the header.

## Using the grid system

Use the grid system to lay out the content on your service’s pages.

Most GOV.IE pages follow a ‘two-thirds and one-third’ layout, but the grid system allows for a number of additional combinations when necessary.

Your main content should always be in a two-thirds column even if you’re not using a corresponding one-third column for secondary content.

## Understanding the grid system

GOV.IE Design System provides a powerful and flexible grid system based on CSS Grid. 

### Basic Grid Structure
To create a grid, you use the `gi-grid` class on a container element. Then, you can specify the number of columns using `gi-grid-cols-{n}` classes, where `{n}` is the number of columns.
For example:

```html
<div class="gi-grid gi-grid-cols-3">
  <div>Column 1</div>
  <div>Column 2</div>
  <div>Column 3</div>
</div>
```
This creates a 3-column grid layout.

### Responsive Grids
It is easy to create responsive grids using breakpoint prefixes. You can specify different column counts for different screen sizes:

```html
<div class="gi-grid gi-grid-cols-1 md:gi-grid-cols-2 lg:gi-grid-cols-4">
  <!-- Grid items -->
</div>
```
This creates a grid that has 1 column on small screens, 2 columns on medium screens, and 4 columns on large screens.

### Grid Gaps
You can add gaps between grid items using the `gi-gap-{size}` classes:

```html
<div class="gi-grid gi-grid-cols-3 gi-gap-4">
  <!-- Grid items -->
</div>
```

### Spanning Columns and Rows
You are allowed to control how items span across columns and rows using classes like `gi-col-span-{n}` and `gi-row-span-{n}`:
```html
<div class="gi-grid gi-grid-cols-3">
  <div class="col-span-2">Spans 2 columns</div>
  <div>Normal column</div>
</div>
```
