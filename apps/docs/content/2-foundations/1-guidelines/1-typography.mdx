# Typography

A well-defined typographic structure enhances the user experience by creating a clear visual hierarchy and guiding users through content seamlessly.

The heading and text scale is responsive, adjusting size based on screen width while remaining accessible. Wider screens use larger type sizes, while narrower screens use smaller settings.

The styles are composed from the primitive type scales, with the addition of primitive font tokens for weight and decoration.

## Responsive behaviour

The heading and display type scale changes based on screen size.

### Heading scale

<HeadingResponsiveSizes />

### Text scale

<TextResponsiveSizes />

## Line length

Line length is between 50 and 75 characters including spaces, to ensure readability and prevent eye strain. Lines shorter than 50 characters create a choppy reading experience, while lines longer than 75 characters make it difficult to move from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.

## Paragraph spacing

To ensure adequate separation between text blocks and facilitate improved readability, margins should be used for headings and paragraphs. For example, headings can use a top margin of `0.5em` and a bottom margin of `1em`, while paragraph text can have a top margin of zero and a bottom margin of `2em`.

## Colour

The primary text colour `color/gray/950`, is the main colour used for all main content, including headings and paragraphs throughout the system.

The secondary text colour, `color/gray/600`, is used sparingly to complement the primary text colour. It is applied to secondary elements such as captions, metadata, or less prominent text to create a visual hierarchy and enhance the overall design.

Both primary and secondary text colours meet AAA contrast compliance standards when used on a white background, ensuring all text is accessible and readable.
