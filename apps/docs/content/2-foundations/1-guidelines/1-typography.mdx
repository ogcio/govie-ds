# Typography

The type scale is designed for accessibility, providing a balanced hierarchy with each font size and line height optimised for readability and in support of a consistent user experience.

## Usage

### Heading heirarchy

Headings are used for structuring content and guiding users through information. The heading scale should be used as follows:

- **Main heading** / Used once per page.
- **Section heading** / Used for main page heading, or major sections within a page.
- **Subsection heading** / Used for subsections within a section of content.
- **Minor subsection heading** / Used within a subsection to further divide content.
- **Body heading (large)** / To be paired with body type of the same size.
- **Body heading (medium)** / To be paired with body type of the same size.
- **Large display** / Used for a hero section, once per page.
- **Medium display** / Used for a hero section, once per page.

## Responsive behaviour

The heading and display type scale changes based on screen size.

### Heading scale

<HeadingResponsiveSizes />

### Text scale

<TextResponsiveSizes />

## Line length

A maximum line length of 65 characters per line, to ensure readability and prevent eye strain.

## Paragraph spacing

To ensure adequate separation between text blocks and facilitate improved readability, margins should be used for headings and paragraphs. For example, headings can use a top margin of `0.5em` and a bottom margin of `1em`, while paragraph text can have a top margin of zero and a bottom margin of `1.5em`.

## Colour

The primary text colour `color/gray/950`, is the main colour used for all main content, including headings and paragraphs throughout the system.

The secondary text colour, `color/gray/600`, is used sparingly to complement the primary text colour. It is applied to secondary elements such as captions, metadata, or less prominent text to create a visual hierarchy and enhance the overall design.

Both primary and secondary text colours meet AAA contrast compliance standards when used on a white background, ensuring all text is accessible and readable.
