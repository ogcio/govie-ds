# Typography

The type scale is designed for accessibility, providing a balanced hierarchy with each font size and line height optimised for readability and in support of a consistent user experience.

## Usage

### Heading heirarchy

Headings are used for structuring content and guiding users through information. The heading scale should be used as follows:

- **Main heading** / Used once per page.
- **Section heading** / Used for main page heading, or major sections within a page.
- **Subsection heading** / Used for subsections within a section of content.
- **Minor subsection heading** / Used within a subsection to further divide content.
- **Body heading (large)** / To be paired with body type of the same size.
- **Body heading (medium)** / To be paired with body type of the same size.
- **Large display** / Used for a hero section, once per page.
- **Medium display** / Used for a hero section, once per page.

## Responsive behaviour

The heading and display type scale changes based on screen size.
