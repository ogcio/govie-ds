# Design Tokens

Tokens store design decisions within the design system. They replace raw values, like hex codes for colour, with contextual names, this allows the system to scale consistently, all while using a shared language with which designers and developers can communicate.

Tokens are the source of truth and stored centrally, allowing updates to be synced to all other elements of the system. They provide flexibility and customisation, giving the option to change the visual theme of a product, while still maintaining the underlying design choices which ensure an accessible and usable experience.
