# Type Scale

Type scales are composed of a few different primitive values from the font tokens, including font family, size, weight, and line height. The combination of these values form scales with consistent increments in sizing. These scales are then used to inform the heading and text scale which are applied to designs. 

## Heading

<TypeScaleHeadingTable />

## Text

<TypeScaleTextTable />
