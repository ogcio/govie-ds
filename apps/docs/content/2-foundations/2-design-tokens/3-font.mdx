# Font

Font properties help to create readable and visually appealing experiences across the system. The primitive font scales are built to include consistent increments for size, weight, line height, and letter spacing. Steps from these scales are then used to feed the composite type scale, which in turn, is used to inform the heading and text scale which are applied to designs.
