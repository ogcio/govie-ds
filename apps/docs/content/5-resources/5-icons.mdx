# Icons

Icons are essential visual elements in any design system, providing users with quick visual cues for actions and information. They improve usability and create a consistent interface across applications, making it easier for users to recognise familiar actions and content types. For more details, check the [Icon component](/components/library/icon/).

The **Icon** component supports multiple sizes and icons, allowing flexibility to meet various design needs. Below is a showcase of all available icons, displayed in small (`sm`), medium (`md`), and large (`lg`) sizes for reference.
