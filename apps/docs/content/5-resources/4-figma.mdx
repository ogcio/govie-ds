# Figma

The Figma library consists of foundations, including styles and variables driven by design tokens, and a component library. These components are the design source that inform the React and HTML component libraries.

The Figma components are used by various teams to create designs, which are then translated into live implementations by engineers using the equivalent code libraries.

Note that the Figma components are currently under construction.

Please check the [current status](/components/) of each Figma component for latest updates.
