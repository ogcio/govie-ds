# Design principles

The Government of Ireland Design System drives the delivery of a unified and inclusive user experience across all digital products and services, ensuring consistency and accessibility for every user.

The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing customisation to fit the unique needs of different government departments and their users.

Whether designing public-facing applications or internal tools, these principles guide the creation of consistent, transparent, and user-centric experiences across all government departments.

### Citizen-centred design

Prioritise the needs, expectations, and experiences of citizens throughout the design process.
Engage in continuous user research to understand the diverse needs of users.
Develop services that are intuitive, easy to navigate, and accessible to users of all abilities.
Use clear and simple language that can be easily understood by everyone.

### Accessibility & inclusivity

Design services that are inclusive and accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.
Adhere to WCAG guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
Conduct usability testing with a diverse group of users to identify and address accessibility issues.
Provide alternative formats and support for users with different needs and preferences.

### Consistency & reliability

Maintain a consistent and reliable user experience across all government digital services.
Develop and adhere to a unified design system that ensures consistency in visual design, interactions, and terminology.
Implement reliable and secure technologies to ensure uninterrupted access to services.
Regularly review and update services to maintain high standards of performance and reliability.

### Transparency & trust

Foster trust by being open, transparent, and honest in the design and delivery of digital services.
Clearly communicate the purpose, benefits, and limitations of services.
Provide straightforward information about data collection, usage, and privacy.
Ensure that all content is accurate, up-to-date, and free from misleading information.
