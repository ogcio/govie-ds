# Developers

The primary goal of the design system is to significantly contribute to the development of Government of Ireland digital products - increasing consistency, quality, efficiency, and accessibility.
This is through a set of detailed [guidelines](/foundations/) and components as both data-driven [HTML components](/components/get-started/html/) and [React components](/components/get-started/react/).

If you an engineer looking to get started with the design system, select your technology stack below for more information:

<Tabs id="devTabs">
  <TabList>
    <TabItem value="devTab1" checked>HTML</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="devTab2">React</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="devTab3">Guidelines</TabItem>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanel value="devTab1">
    Use the **HTML components** with HTML markup.

    If you are using plain HTML files with no server side technology, we recommend using the [HTML components](/components/get-started/html/) with the HTML markup directly.

    You should favour global components where available over local components. Local components are marked as deprecated in the HTML components Storybook when a global equivalent is available.
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="devTab2">
    Use the **React components**.

    If you are building React applications with Next.js or Vite, then you should use the [React components](/components/get-started/react/).

    The components are in early development, so the set available will expand over time as we go through the component globalisation process.

  <TabPanel value="devTab3">
    Use the **guidelines**.

    You are using a technology stack that is currently not supported. We recommend that you investigate the [HTML components](/components/get-started/html/) to see if they may be appropriate for your use case.

    Alternatively, you may decide to develop your own set of components directly, in which case they should follow the [guidelines](/foundations/) available to ensure consistency with the design system.

    If you believe your technology stack should be supported by the design system, then please [contact the design system team](/contact/).
