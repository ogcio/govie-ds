**Familiarise yourself with Foundations**

Start by looking through the documentation for the colours, typography, and spacing, these foundations permeate throughout the rest of the system.

**Explore Components**
Check out the component library in Figma. It contains reusable elements that ensure consistency across projects. [Link]

**Stay Updated**
The component library is undergoing updates. By reaching out to the design system team, we will ensure that updates to the libraries are communicated regularly. [Link]
