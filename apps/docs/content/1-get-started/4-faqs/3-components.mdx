<Faq question="What is a component?">

A component is a modular, reusable piece of a user interface that can be independently created, tested, and maintained. Components are the building blocks of digital products, designed to encapsulate specific functionality and appearance. They can range from simple elements like buttons and form fields to more complex structures like navigation menus or data tables.

<Faq question="What components are provided by the design system?">

The design system includes vanilla [HTML components](/components/html/) that are local and stable and an alpha library of [React components](/components/react/) currently under development.

<Faq question="What are local components?">

The existing [HTML components](/components/html/) are described as **local** because they are tailored for usage within a gov.ie context. The components are styled for specific use cases, so may not be suitable for your needs.
The design system team is in the process of **globalising** the available components.

<Faq question="What are global components?">

The term **global** conveys the idea that global components are designed to work across various contexts, platforms, or brands, making them flexible and adaptable to different needs.

In particular, global components:

- Have **component anatomy documentation** available
- Have **guidelines** available for their usage
- Are available as a **design component** within Figma
- Are built as an **HTML component**, including macro
- Are built as a **React component**
- Use design tokens so that they are **themeable** across both design and engineering
