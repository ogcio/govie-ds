<Faq question="What is a component?">

A component is a modular, reusable piece of a user interface that can be independently created, tested, and maintained. Components are the building blocks of digital products, designed to encapsulate specific functionality and appearance. They can range from simple elements like buttons and form fields to more complex structures like navigation menus or data tables.

</Faq>

<Faq question="What components are provided by the design system?">

The design system includes vanilla [HTML components](/components/html/) that are **local** and stable and an alpha library of [React components](/components/react/) currently under development.

</Faq>

<Faq question="What are local components?">

The existing [HTML components](/components/html/) are described as **local** because they are tailored for usage within a gov.ie context. The components are styled for specific use cases, so may not be suitable for your needs.
The design system team is in the process of **globalising** the components.

</Faq>

<Faq question="What are global components?">

The term **global** conveys the idea that global components are designed to work across various contexts, platforms, or brands, making them flexible and adaptable to different needs.

In particular, global components:

- Have **component anatomy documentation** available
- Have **guidelines** available for their usage
- Are available as a **design component** within Figma
- Are built as an **HTML component**, including macro
- Are built as a **React component**
- Use design tokens so that they are **themeable** across both design and engineering

</Faq>

<Faq question="How will the local components be globalised?">

The existing [HTML component](/components/html/) implementations are undergoing the following globalisation process, converting a single HTML component at a time from local to global based on priority:

- Review design of the component
- Implement as a design component within Figma
- Document component anatomy
- Document component guidelines
- Implement the component in HTML using design tokens
- Implement the component in React using design tokens
- Document the component usage in HTML and React
- Mark the local component as deprecated and provide links to the global component

</Faq>

<Faq question="How do you determine the order in which local components are globalised?">

The components will be globalised based on the needs of departments with which we are currently collaborating and on usage statistics across various digital products.
The current priority is reflected in the [component status](/components/status/) information.
If you are interested in particular components being made available globally, then please [contact the design system team](/contact/).

</Faq>

<Faq question="Should I use the local HTML components if they are being globalised?">

Yes, the existing local HTML components will be supported whilst they are being globalised.
When a global version of a component is made available, the existing local version will be deprecated, but the local version will continue working unaffected.
You can run the local version for as long as needed, and update to the global version when convenient for you.
