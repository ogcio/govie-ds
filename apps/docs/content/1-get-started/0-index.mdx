# Introduction

The Government of Ireland Design System is for all government digital products and services. There is a full-time team of designers and developers building and maintaining the system, with dedicated resources to onboard new users.

## Elements of the system

The system consists of various elements, some of which are independent of technical frameworks, such as the guidelines on this documentation site, design tokens, and the Figma component library. There are also specific component libraries available, including vanilla HTML and React.
