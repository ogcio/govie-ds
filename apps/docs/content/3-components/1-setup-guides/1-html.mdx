# HTML Components

The [Gov IE Frontend](https://github.com/ogcio/ogcio-ds/) project is a set of vanilla HTML components that implement the design system.

These components are lightweight, versatile, and can be easily integrated into any project without relying on additional frameworks.

Installation and usage guidelines are available at the [Gov IE Frontend Storybook](https://storybook.design-system.ogcio.gov.ie/) site.

Note that the HTML components are currently under **design review**. Component designs and implementations will change over time, but any breaking changes will be handled with major version increments.

We are also reviewing mechanisms to abstract away the underlying HTML markup when consuming components to simplify updates as components change.

Please check the [current status](/components/status/) of each HTML component for latest updates.
