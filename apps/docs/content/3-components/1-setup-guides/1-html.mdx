# HTML Components

A version of the design system implemented as HTML components.
These components are designed to be used in any HTML-based project, including static sites, server-rendered applications, and client-side applications.
These components are not tied to any specific framework or library, and can be used with any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript setup.

## Install using precompiled files

You can install the Gov IE Frontend global HTML components by copying the CSS, JavaScript, and macro files into your project.
This is the recommended way to use the Gov IE Frontend HTML components if you are not using a build tool or package manager.

### Download the files

1. Download the `govie-frontend.zip` asset file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/releases) of `@govie-ds/html`.
2. Download the `theme.zip` asset file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/releases) of `@govie-ds/theme-govie`.

### Copy CSS and JavaScript

1. Copy the `theme.css` file from `theme.zip` to a folder that can serve static CSS files, e.g. `static/css`.
2. Copy the `styles.css` file from `govie-frontend.zip` to a folder that can serve static CSS files, e.g. `static/css`.
3. Copy the `govie-frontend.umd.js` file from `govie-frontend.zip` to a folder that can serve static JavaScript files, e.g. `static/js`.

> Note that the template needs to include the `theme.css`, `styles.css`, and `govie-frontend.umd.js` files previously copied to a folder that can serve static files.

### Include the CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/theme.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css">
  <title>Gov IE Frontend</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Gov IE Frontend</h1>
  <p>This is a sample page using Gov IE Frontend HTML components.</p>

  <!-- Important: add it as last script -->
  <script src="/static/js/govie-frontend.umd.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Notes

Pay attention when components contain the `data-module` attribute.
This attribute is used to initialize the component and should not be removed or modified.
The `data-module` attribute value starts with `gieds-` and is followed by the component name.
Check the component documentation for the correct value of the `data-module` attribute.
