# HTML Components

A version of the design system implemented as HTML Templates components is currently under development.

These are idiomatic components suitable for applications developed with `Nunjucks` or Jinja.

Note that the HTML components are currently under **design review**. Component designs and implementations will change over time, but any breaking changes will be handled with major version increments.

We are also reviewing mechanisms to abstract away the underlying HTML markup when consuming components to simplify updates as components change.

Please check the [current status](/components/) of each HTML component for latest updates.

## Install using precompiled files

You can install the Gov IE Frontend global HTML components by copying the CSS, JavaScript, and macro files into your project.

### Download the files

1. Download the `govie-frontend.zip` asset file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/releases) of `@govie-ds/html`.
2. Download the `theme.zip` asset file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ogcio/govie-ds/releases) of `@govie-ds/theme-govie`.

### Integration with Wagtail

#### Copy CSS and JavaScript

1. Copy the `theme.css` file from `theme.zip` to a folder that can serve static CSS files, e.g. `static/css`.
2. Copy the `styles.css` file from `govie-frontend.zip` to a folder that can serve static CSS files, e.g. `static/css`.
3. Copy the `govie-frontend.umd.js` file from `govie-frontend.zip` to a folder that can serve static JavaScript files, e.g. `static/js`.

> Note that the template needs to include the `theme.css`, `styles.css`, and `govie-frontend.umd.js` files previously copied to a folder that can serve static files.
