# React Components

A version of the design system implemented as React components is currently under development.

These are idiomatic components suitable for modern React applications, for example developed with Next.js or Vite.

<Highlight>

The React components are current in **alpha** so will undergo multiple breaking changes until they reach version 1.0.

Please check the [current status](/components/status/) of each React component for latest updates.

If you are interested in the use of React components that implement the design system, please [contact the design system team](/contact/).

## Install with Node.js package manager (npm)

**This library should only be imported for departments actively working with the core design system team during its development. Do not use this library if you are not part of this development process, and contact the design system team instead if you interested in its use.**

Welcome to the GOV IE React component library, a collection of reusable React components designed to help you build modern React web applications utilising the GOV IE design system.

**Status: Alpha**

> Important Note: This library is currently in the **alpha** stage. As we continue to develop and improve the components, **frequent breaking changes are to be expected**. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards a stable version 1.0.

## Getting Started

To install the library, use the following command:

```
npm install @govie-react/ds @govie-ds/theme-govie
```

### Pinning packages

We **strongly recommend** that you pin the GOV IE design system packages, so that any regressions are not automatically introduced during development. Regressions that will only be discoverable at runtime.

**Upgrades should be explicit version updates** in the `package.json` and then your application should be regression tested:

```diff
"dependencies": {
-  "@govie-ds/theme-govie": "^0.4.0",
+  "@govie-ds/theme-govie": "0.4.0",
-  "@govie-react/ds": "^0.10.0",
+  "@govie-react/ds": "0.10.0"
```

### Usage

Import the GOV IE `theme.css` from the `@govie-ds/theme-govie` theme package at the entry point of your application, for example:

```diff
+import '@govie-ds/theme-govie/theme.css'

export function App() {
  return (
    ...
  );
}
```

> Note that you should typically run some form of CSS reset or normalisation of styles as part of your application entry point, depending on your application styling solution. For example Tailwind includes [preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight), an opinionated set of base styles.

Use components within your application from the `@govie-react/ds` component package:

```jsx
import { Header } from '@govie-react/ds';

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header serviceName="My Service" />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Typography

The `@govie-react/ds` package contains `Heading` and `Paragraph` components that implement the GOV IE design system responsive text guidelines:

```jsx
import { Heading, Paragraph } from '@govie-react/ds';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Heading>Heading</Heading>
      <Paragraph>This is a paragraph</Paragraph>
    </>
  );
}
```

The GOV IE design system uses the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) Google font. The font should be added to your application, e.g. via [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/install) or embed code.
