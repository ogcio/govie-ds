## When to use this component

Use the `Pagination` component when you need to display a set of paginated content across multiple pages. Itâ€™s especially useful for content-heavy applications, where users need to navigate between pages of results or items. It helps to:

- Break down large sets of data or content into smaller, more manageable chunks.
- Provide intuitive and clear navigation controls, such as "Previous", "Next", and specific page numbers.
- Dynamically adjust the number of pages based on the total content available.

<br />

### Typical use cases:

- Pagination in a blog or article listing.
- Navigating between pages in search results.
- Handling large datasets in dashboards or analytics platforms.

## When not to use this component

Avoid using the `Pagination` component when:

- The content is not split into multiple pages, and all data can be shown at once without performance concerns.
- Your design requires infinite scrolling or loading data dynamically as the user scrolls, instead of dividing it into fixed page numbers.
- You don't want to provide manual control to navigate between pages (e.g., for very simple content where only a single page is required).

Consider other navigation or layout patterns when:

- The number of pages is so large that pagination becomes cumbersome.
- You have complex filtering or sorting systems that could be better navigated using a different UI paradigm (e.g., a side navigation bar or collapsible sections).

### Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure that screen readers can properly announce the active page and total pages.
- Provide clear visual indicators of the current page, using styles or ARIA roles to enhance accessibility.
