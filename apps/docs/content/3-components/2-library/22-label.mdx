# Label

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="label" />

The `Label` component is used to associate a text label with a form input element, helping improve accessibility and user experience. The `size` prop allows you to adjust the label size based on the form's design requirements.

## When to Use This Component

- **Form Labels**: Use this component whenever you need to label form elements like text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, or radio buttons to improve accessibility and usability.
- **Responsive Text**: Use the `size` prop to control the text size, making it larger or smaller based on the context of the form or layout.

- **Accessibility**: The `htmlFor` prop ensures the label is properly associated with the corresponding input element, which improves accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

## When Not to Use This Component

- **Standalone Text**: If you need a simple text element that’s not associated with a form control, use a standard text component rather than `Label`.

- **Non-Label Content**: If the element you are wrapping isn’t directly connected to an input (e.g., a non-interactive description), consider using a `span`, `p`, or another semantic element instead of `Label`.
