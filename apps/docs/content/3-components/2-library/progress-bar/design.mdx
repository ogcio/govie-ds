# Progress Bar

A progress bar is a visual indicator that shows the status or completion level of a process. It provides users with feedback on the progress of ongoing tasks, such as file uploads, downloads, or form submissions.

## Usage

Progress bars are commonly used to visually communicate the status of ongoing operations. For example, when uploading a file, a progress bar can show how much of the file has been uploaded and how much remains. They can also be used in multi-step forms to indicate completion, or during data processing tasks to reassure users that the process is underway.

- Ensure progress bars are visually distinct and easy to interpret against their background for clarity.
- Place progress bars close to the task or content they represent to maintain contextual relevance.
- Provide additional textual feedback (e.g., percentage complete or estimated time) to improve user understanding, especially for long-duration tasks.

### Do's

- Use a determinate progress bar when the progress of a task can be measured (e.g., file upload, form completion).
- Use an indeterminate progress bar when the duration of a task is unknown but progress should be indicated (e.g., loading state).
- Use progress bars for tasks that take longer than a few seconds.
- Provide clear labels and context for the progress bar.

### Don'ts

- Don't use progress bars for short tasks that can be completed quickly.
- Don't make the progress bar the only indicator of progress; provide additional context or information as needed.
