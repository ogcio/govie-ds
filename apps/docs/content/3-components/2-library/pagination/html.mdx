# Pagination

The Pagination component provides a navigational control that helps users move between multiple pages of content. It is typically used in scenarios such as search results, tables, or lists where content is split across several pages. The HTML version of the component is styled and structured using standard markup and can be integrated into any frontend stack that supports HTML and CSS.

<Section current="html">

  <Pagination currentPage={5} totalPages={10} />
