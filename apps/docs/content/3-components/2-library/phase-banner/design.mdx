# Phase Banner

Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.  
It helps communicate that the service is in an early stage (alpha or beta).

<Section current="design">

<ComponentContainer>
  <PhaseBanner level="alpha">
    This is a new service – your <Link href="/">feedback</Link> will help us to
    improve it.
  </PhaseBanner>
</ComponentContainer>

<FigmaPreviewButton href="https://www.figma.com/design/ZEqfpXhocdZs1K5YfsE5ws/Design-system?node-id=8640-57605&m=dev" />

## Usage

### Do

- Use the phase banner to clearly indicate when a service is in **alpha** or **beta**.
- Provide links for feedback to improve the service.

### Don’t

<ComponentContainer>
  <PhaseBanner level="alpha">Welcome to GOV.IE</PhaseBanner>
</ComponentContainer>
