# Phase Banner

Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.  
It helps communicate that the service is in an early stage (alpha or beta).

<Section current="design">

<ComponentPreview>
  <PhaseBanner level="Alpha">
    {`This is a new service – your `} <Link href="/">feedback</Link>{' '}
    {` will help us to improve it.`}
  </PhaseBanner>
</ComponentPreview>
