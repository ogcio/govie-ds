# Footer

The GOV.IE footer provides copyright, licensing and other information about your service.

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="footer" />

## When to use this component

Use the footer at the bottom of every page of your service.

## Adding links

You can add links to:

- privacy notice
- accessibility statement
- cookies page
- terms and conditions
- other language options
- help content

Use ‘Privacy’, ‘Accessibility’, ‘Cookies’ and ‘Terms and conditions’ for the link text.

## Adding secondary navigation

Only add secondary GOV.IE navigation if you’re creating a GOV.IE service, and you want users to be able to navigate away from the service to somewhere else on the GOV.IE website. For example, you probably don’t want to encourage a user to navigate away from a linear, form-type service.
