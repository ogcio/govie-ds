# Header

The Header component functions as a top-level navigation element for digital services across government departments and public sector organisations. It offers users a consistent and recognisable interface that builds trust, supports a unified brand identity, and delivers key navigation tools. Originally referred to as the GOV.IE masthead, this component is designed to signal to users that they are engaging with an official government service while providing easy access to essential site-wide features. It is adaptable for use beyond GOV.IE, supporting a broad range of departmental and agency websites.
