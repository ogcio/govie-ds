# Accordion

The Accordion component allows users to expand and collapse sections of content, making it ideal for organizing large amounts of information in a compact format. 
It is particularly useful for FAQs, forms, and other content that benefits from being grouped into collapsible sections.

## Usage

The Accordion component is best used when you need to organize and present large amounts of related content in a compact, user-friendly way. 
It helps users quickly scan headings and expand only the sections they are interested in, reducing information overload. 
Common use cases include FAQs, multi-step forms, and settings panels. Each AccordionItem should have a clear, descriptive label to ensure accessibility and ease of navigation.

### DOs

- **Use clear, descriptive labels** for each AccordionItem so users know what content to expect.
- **Group related content** together to help users scan and find information quickly.
- **Keep content concise** within each section to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Ensure keyboard accessibility** and proper focus management for all interactive elements.

### DON'Ts

- **Don't use vague or generic labels** like "Section 1" or "More info".
- **Don't nest accordions** inside each other, as this can confuse users.
- **Don't overload a single accordion** with too many items; consider breaking up content if needed.
- **Don't hide critical information** that users must see to complete a task.
