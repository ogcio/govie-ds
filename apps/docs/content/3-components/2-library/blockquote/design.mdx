# Blockquote

Use the blockquote component to visually emphasise quoted or cited content, especially when referencing external sources or highlighting key statements.

<Section current="design">

<ComponentPreview>
  <Blockquote cite="https://example.com/source">
    It can take up to 8 weeks to register a lasting power of attorney if there
    are no mistakes in the application.
  </Blockquote>
</ComponentPreview>

## Variants

<ComponentPreviewLayout className="flex-col">
  <ComponentPreviewItem className="block h-auto w-max">
    <Blockquote cite="https://example.com/source">
      The source URL or description for the quotation.
    </Blockquote>
  </ComponentPreviewItem>
</ComponentPreviewLayout>

## Usage

Blockquotes are used to display content quoted from another source. They help draw attention to important excerpts or testimonials and should include a citation when referencing external content.

### Do

- Use blockquotes to highlight important or quoted content.
- Always include a citation when quoting external sources.
- Ensure accessibility by using semantic elements properly.
- Keep the content concise and relevant to the surrounding text.

<ComponentContainer>
  <Blockquote cite="https://gov.uk/lpa">
    It can take up to 8 weeks to register a lasting power of attorney if there
    are no mistakes in the application.
  </Blockquote>
</ComponentContainer>

### Don't

- Don’t use blockquotes for styling non-quoted content.
- Avoid overusing blockquotes; they should emphasise, not distract.
- Don’t omit the citation when the quote is from an external source.
- Avoid nesting blockquotes unless absolutely necessary.
