# Progress Bar

Use the progress bar component to visually represent the progress of a task or operation.

## Variants

### Determinate Progress

<ComponentContainer>
  <ProgressBar currentValue="40" finalValue="100" size="sm" />
</ComponentContainer>

### Indeterminate Progress

<ComponentContainer>
  <ProgressBar
    isIndeterminate="true"
    label="Loading..."
    size="sm"
    color="blue"
  />
</ComponentContainer>

## Usage

### Best Practices

#### When to use this component

- Use a determinate progress bar when the progress of a task can be measured (e.g., file upload, form completion).
- Use an indeterminate progress bar when the duration of a task is unknown but progress should be indicated (e.g., loading state).

#### When not to use this component

- Avoid using a progress bar for static values that do not visually indicate progress.
- Do not use a progress bar if the task completion time is very short, as it might appear unresponsive to the user.

### Accessibility

- Always include an appropriate label for screen readers to describe the task being performed.
- For determinate progress, ensure the current value and total value are conveyed to assistive technologies.
