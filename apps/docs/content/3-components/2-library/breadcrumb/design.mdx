# Breadcrumbs

The Breadcrumbs component displays the user's current location within a site's hierarchy and provides easy navigation to previous levels. It supports icons, custom links, and ellipsis to manage complex paths while maintaining accessibility and clarity.

## Usage

Use breadcrumbs to help users understand their location within a website or application hierarchy and navigate back to higher levels easily.

### Do

- Use breadcrumbs when your content has a hierarchical structure.
- Keep breadcrumb items concise and relevant.
- Use ellipsis to avoid overloading when there are many levels.

### Don't

- Don’t use breadcrumbs in flat navigation structures.
- Don’t include unnecessary levels just to fill space.
- Don’t overload breadcrumbs with icons or complex elements.

## Mobile Guidelines

On mobile, space is limited, so breadcrumbs should remain lightweight and unobtrusive.  
The recommended approach is:

- Show only the most relevant levels (for example, the current page and one or two parent levels).
- Use ellipsis (`…`) to collapse intermediate paths when the hierarchy is long.
- Ensure touch targets remain large enough for easy tapping.
- Avoid wrapping breadcrumbs into multiple lines.

The developer is responsible for controlling which breadcrumb items are rendered in mobile. The component itself does not manage item reduction or truncation — this logic must be implemented in your app.
