# Heading

A Heading is a typographic element used to define the titles and subtitles of sections on a page. It helps organize content, establish hierarchy, and improve readability by visually distinguishing different levels of information.

<Section current="design">

<ComponentPreview>
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'}}>
    <Heading as="h1">This is an h1</Heading>
    <Heading as="h2">This is an h2</Heading>
    <Heading as="h3">This is an h3</Heading>
    <Heading as="h4">This is an h4</Heading>
    <Heading as="h5">This is an h5</Heading>
    <Heading as="h6">This is an h6</Heading>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

## Variants

### With a caption

<ComponentContainer>
  <Heading caption="This is a caption">This is a heading</Heading>
</ComponentContainer>

## Usage

Use heading as, such as `<h1>`, `<h2>` and so on, to tag the headings on a page. Style headings consistently to create a clear content structure throughout your service.
For a question page, or pages with long headings, follow the usual hierarchy of heading levels and styles associated with them. For example, `<h1>`, followed by an `<h2>` and so on. In rare cases, you might want to alter how you use the headings hierarchy to achieve a better visual balance. An example of this is in the design systemâ€™s notification banner which uses heading levels in a different order to emphasise the most important information. If you do change the heading hierarchy in a similar way, it needs to go through accessibility testing before use.
Write all headings in sentence case.

### Do

- Use `<h1>` for the main page heading; only one `<h1>` per page.
- Use headings in a logical order: `<h1>`, then `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.
- Write headings in sentence case for clarity and consistency.
- Ensure headings describe the content that follows.
- Use headings to create a clear content structure and improve accessibility.

### Don't

- Skip heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h1>` to `<h4>`).
- Use headings purely for visual styling; use them for semantic structure.
- Use multiple `<h1>` elements on the same page.
- Write headings in all caps or with inconsistent casing.
- Make headings too vague or unrelated to the content below.
