The component is customizable, supporting various file types, size limits, and even batch uploads, making it versatile for a wide range of use cases. Whether for uploading personal data or sharing project files, this component is a key part of modern web interactions.

## When to use this component

- When users need to upload one or more files (e.g., documents, images, etc.) from their local device to your system.
- When form submissions require attachments, such as resumes, profile pictures, or reports.
- In scenarios where users need to manage or update existing files by uploading new versions.
- If your application supports bulk or batch file uploads for user convenience.
- When allowing users to interact with cloud storage by uploading files directly.

## When not to use this component

- When users are only expected to input text or structured data (e.g., forms with text fields or dropdowns).
- If the file size is extremely large and uploading is not feasible; consider alternative methods like cloud sharing links.
- When files are not required or relevant to the action being performed by the user (e.g., simple registration forms).
- When you're using drag-and-drop file management without traditional file upload buttons (unless the upload is supplemental).
- In cases where inline file previews and edits are the primary user interaction, rather than uploading files.
