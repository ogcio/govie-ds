# Chip

The Chip component is a compact element used to represent tags, selections, or input. In HTML, chips are typically implemented using a combination of `div` or `span` elements styled appropriately, and may include a button for dismissal if they are meant to be removable. Chips should be keyboard-accessible and support semantic labeling via `aria` attributes when used interactively.
