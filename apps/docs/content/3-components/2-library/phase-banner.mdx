# Phase Banner

Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="phase-banner" />

<ComponentContainer>
  <PhaseBanner level="alpha">This is a new service - your <Link href='/'>feedback</Link> will help us to improve it.</PhaseBanner>
</ComponentContainer>

## When to use this component

Services hosted on a GOV.IE domain must use the phase banner until they pass a live assessment.
