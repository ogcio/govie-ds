# Section Break

You can use the Section Break component to create a thematic break between sections of content.
The section break has modifiers for different size margins.

<Section current="design">

<ComponentPreview>
  <SectionBreak size="md" />
</ComponentPreview>

## Usage

Section Breaks are used to create visual separation between different sections of content. They help improve readability and organization within a page.

### Do

- Use section breaks to clearly delineate different sections of content.
- Ensure there is sufficient spacing around the section break to maintain visual clarity.

### Don't

- Overuse section breaks, which can lead to a cluttered appearance.
- Use section breaks for minor content changes that do not require visual separation.
