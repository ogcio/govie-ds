## Usage

### Best Practices

### When to use this component

Use this component if your service sets any cookies on a user’s device.

This component page shows several options for using a cookie banner, based on the types of cookies you’re using in the service. We also tell you what to cover in your cookie banner, with some text examples.

### When not to use this component

You can choose not to have a cookie banner if the service only sets essential or ‘strictly necessary’ cookies, as these do not need user consent.

However, you must tell users that you set essential cookies. You can do this with a cookies page – link to this page in the footer.
