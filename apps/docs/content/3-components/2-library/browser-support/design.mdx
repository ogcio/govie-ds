# Browser Support

The BrowserSupport component detects the user's browser and shows a dismissible warning when it falls below the supported policy. It's silent on supported browsers and surfaces a link to the official supported browsers page.

<Section current="design">

## When to use

- Notify users on **outdated/unsupported** browsers.
- Provide a **safe, actionable path** to update/switch browsers.
- Keep supported users **uninterrupted** (no banner).

## Usage

### Do

- **Place at app-shell level**: mount once in app layout to cover all routes.
- **Keep the message concise**: state the problem and action.
- **Respect dismissal**: allow users to close the banner (don''t re-open immediately).

### Don't

- **Don't block the UI**: this is a warning, not a hard stop.
- **Don't stack multiple banners**: rely on the built-in owner control.
- **Don't rely on color alone**: keep the textual message.
