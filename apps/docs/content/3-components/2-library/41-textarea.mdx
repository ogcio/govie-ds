# Textarea

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="textarea" />

The `Textarea` component allows users to input multi-line text. Itâ€™s ideal for longer text fields, such as descriptions, messages, or comments, and offers flexibility in terms of size using `rows` and `cols` props.

## When to use this component

- **Multi-line input**: Use `Textarea` when the input requires multiple lines of text, such as:
  - Feedback forms, comments, or reviews
  - Messages, descriptions, or instructions
  - Long-form text fields like addresses or notes
- **Variable text length**: Use it when you cannot predict how long the user's input will be, but expect it to exceed a single line.
- **Custom size control**: Use `rows` and `cols` to control the visible size of the text box, tailoring the component to your layout needs.

## When not to use this component

- **Single-line input**: If you only expect short, single-line inputs (e.g., names, email addresses), use the `TextInput` component instead.
- **Structured data input**: For specialised inputs like dates, numbers, or selections from predefined options, use components like `DateInput`, `NumberInput`, or `Select` instead of `Textarea`.
- **Large text area**: If the input area becomes too large (like for editing full documents or code), consider a more robust solution, such as a dedicated text editor component or even a rich text editor.
