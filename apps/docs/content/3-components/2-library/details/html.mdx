# Details

The Details component is a semantic HTML element that lets users toggle the visibility of content. It’s ideal for progressively disclosing supporting information such as help text, guidance, or definitions. This implementation uses the native `<details>` and `<summary>` tags, ensuring built-in accessibility and expected browser behavior.

<Section current="html">

<ComponentPreview className="justify-normal">
  <Details label="Help with Nationality">
    We need to know your nationality so we can work out which elections you’re
    entitled to vote in. If you cannot provide your nationality, you’ll have to
    send copies of identity documents through the post.
  </Details>
</ComponentPreview>
