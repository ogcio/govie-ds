# Details

The React `Details` component provides an accessible, semantic way to progressively disclose information in your interface. It's a wrapper around the native HTML `<details>` element with additional enhancements like controlled open state and optional grouping by `name`.

<Section current="react">

<ComponentPreview className="justify-normal">
  <Details label="Help with Nationality">
    We need to know your nationality so we can work out which elections you’re
    entitled to vote in. If you cannot provide your nationality, you’ll have to
    send copies of identity documents through the post.
  </Details>
