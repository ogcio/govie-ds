## Usage

### Details Props

- **label** (optional): The text displayed in the summary of the details element. This serves as the clickable label to expand or collapse the content.
- **name** (optional): A string used to group multiple "details" elements. If multiple "details" elements have the same `name`, only one can be open at a time. Opening one will automatically close any others within the same group.
- **children** (optional): The content inside the details element, which is displayed when the details section is open.
- **open** (optional): A boolean that, when `true`, shows the details content by default. If absent or `false`, the details are collapsed initially.

### Best Practices

#### When to use this component

The Details component is best used for displaying content that users can optionally reveal or hide, such as:

- Additional information or explanations.
- Technical details that are not immediately required but may help the user.

The user can also set the "open" attribute on the "details" HTML element to control whether the component starts in an open state.
This allows you to highlight important content or pre-expand relevant sections for your users.

#### When not to use this component

Avoid using the `Details` component for critical information that must always be visible. If the content is crucial for the user to proceed, consider placing it directly on the page instead.
