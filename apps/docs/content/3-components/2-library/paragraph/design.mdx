# Paragraph

The Paragraph component provides consistent, responsive typography for body and inline text. It ensures readability and spacing across applications, with flexible size and element options (`p` or `span`).

## Variants

### Sizes

<ComponentContainer>

## Usage

Use the Paragraph component to create clear, consistent text blocks across your application. It supports both block (`<p>`) and inline (`<span>`) elements, offers size variants (`sm`, `md`, `lg`), and provides alignment and whitespace options to adapt text for different contexts while maintaining readability.

### Do

- Use the Paragraph component to display text content with consistent styling across your application.
- Use `<p>` for block text and `as="span"` for inline text.
- Adjust the `size` property (`lg`, `md`, `sm`) to create hierarchy between headings, subheadings, and body text.
- Keep text blocks readable and well-spaced to follow the design system guidelines.

<ComponentContainer>
  <Paragraph size="md" align="start">
    {`Use Paragraph for body text to ensure consistency and readability.`}
  </Paragraph>
</ComponentContainer>

### Don't

- Don't use Paragraph as a replacement for headings or labels that have their own components.
- Don't center large blocks of text unless there is a strong design reason — it reduces readability.
- Don't rely on Paragraph for highly customised text styles or complex formatting needs.

  <ComponentContainer>
    <Paragraph size="lg" align="center">
      {`Avoid centering large text blocks — it hurts readability.`}
    </Paragraph>
  </ComponentContainer>
