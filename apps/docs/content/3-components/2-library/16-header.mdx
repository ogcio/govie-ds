# Header

The GOV.IE header component tells users they’re using a service on GOV.IE and lets them use GOV.IE-wide tools. Also known as the GOV.IE masthead.

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="header" />

## When to use this component

You must use the GOV.IE header component at the top of every page. The Service Manual explains why it’s important for you to make your service look like GOV.IE.

## When not to use this component

If your service is not hosted on one of the GOV.IE domains outlined, you must not use the GOV.IE header component as it’s not considered part of GOV.IE.
You can still build from this component, but you’ll need to make some changes to make sure users do not confuse your website with GOV.IE.

## How it works

The GOV.IE header component ensure users get a consistent experience on GOV.IE.

This also assures users that they’re in the right place to use your service and to understand that GOV.IE functions as one website.

For guidance on how to plan your header and navigation, see the Help users navigate a service pattern.
