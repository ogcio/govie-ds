# Score Select

Score Select is used to collect a rating score from users, typically in the form of Net Promoter Score (NPS). It displays a horizontal row of buttons representing numeric values from 0 to 10, and includes labels on either side to help frame the scale.

<Section current="design">

<ComponentPreview>
  <ScoreSelect
    label="How satisfied are you with your experience?"
    leftLabel="Very Dissatisfied"
    name="opinion-scale-7"
    rightLabel="Very Satisfied"
    size="large"
    type="1-7"
  />
</ComponentPreview>

## Usage

Use the `ScoreSelect` component when you need a quick and intuitive way to collect user ratings, such as:

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** surveys.
- **Satisfaction ratings** or **feedback forms** requiring numeric ratings.
- Collecting user **opinions** on a Likert scale.

### Do

- **Provide clear, descriptive end labels**: "Not Likely" and "Extremely Likely".
- **Choose an appropriate scale for the task**: 1–5, 1–7, or 0–10.

### Don't

- **Don't use unclear or subjective wording like “Good?” or “Bad?”**: Ambiguity reduces the reliability of responses.
- **Don't overload the scale with multiple questions at once**: Each scale should only measure one thing.
- **Don't mix scales on the same page (for example, a 1–5 and a 0–10 side by side)**: This creates inconsistency and confuses respondents.
- **Don't skip labels entirely — without context**: Users may interpret the numbers differently.
- **Don't use this component for continuous values (like age or percentage)**: Where a slider or numeric input would be more appropriate.

**Example:**

<ComponentContainer>
  <ScoreSelect
    label="Rate it"
    name="mixed-scale"
    type="0-10"
    leftLabel="Bad?"
    rightLabel="Good?"
    size="small"
  />
</ComponentContainer>
