# Blockquote

## Variants

### Default

<ComponentContainer>
  <Blockquote>It can take up to 8 weeks to register a lasting power of attorney if there are no mistakes in the application.</Blockquote>
</ComponentContainer>

## Usage

### Best Practices

### When to use this component

Use the inset text component to differentiate a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information about the page

### When not to use this component

Some users do not notice inset text if itâ€™s used on complex pages or near to other visually prominent elements.
For this reason, avoid using inset text as a way of highlighting very important information that users need to see.

If you need to draw attention to very important content, like legal information, use the warning text component instead.

## Status
