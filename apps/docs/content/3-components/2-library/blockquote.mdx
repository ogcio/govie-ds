# Blockquote

<ComponentStatusBlock componentId="blockquote" />

## When to use this component

Use the inset text component to differentiate a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- quotes
- examples
- additional information about the page

## When not to use this component

Some users do not notice inset text if itâ€™s used on complex pages or near to other visually prominent elements.
For this reason, avoid using inset text as a way of highlighting very important information that users need to see.

If you need to draw attention to very important content, like legal information, use the warning text component instead.
