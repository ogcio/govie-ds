# Data Table

Data tables are used to visually represent and manage large sets of information in a structured format. They allow users to easily scan, filter, and manipulate data.

## Components

### Header

The header section includes an area for filtering options, a title, and action buttons relative to the whole table.

/>

Once the user applies a filter, a filter bar appears below the header, showing the active filters and providing options to clear them.

### Row action bar

The row action bar appears when a user selects one or multiple rows and provides options for actions that can be performed on the selected row(s). This may include buttons for editing, deleting, or performing bulk actions.

### Content

The content section displays the main data in a tabular format, with each row representing a single record and each column representing a specific attribute of that record.
Columns are sortable, allowing users to organize data based on their preferences. Additionally, rows can be selected for bulk actions or individual operations.
The cell can be editable, enabling users to modify data directly within the table without navigating away.

### Footer

The footer section typically includes pagination controls, summary information, and additional actions related to the entire table.

## Usage

Use the data table component to display and manage large sets of information in a structured format. Data tables are particularly useful for:
- Displaying tabular data that requires sorting, filtering, and pagination.
- Allowing users to edit data directly within the table.
- Enabling bulk actions on selected rows.

### Do

- Use clear and descriptive column headers.
- Provide filtering and sorting options for users.
- Allow inline editing of table cells.
- Include pagination controls in the footer.

### Donâ€™t

- Overwhelm users with too much information at once.
- Use non-standard table layouts that confuse users.
- Disable keyboard navigation within the table.
- Forget to provide feedback for user actions (e.g., saving edits).
