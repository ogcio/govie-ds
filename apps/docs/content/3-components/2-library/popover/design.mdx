## Usage

To use a popover, wrap the trigger element (such as a button or icon) with the Popover component and provide the content to display inside the popover. Popovers are commonly used for menus, or additional actions.

### Do

- Use popovers to provide additional information or actions related to a specific element without navigating away from the current page.
- Ensure that the popover content is concise and relevant to the trigger element.
- Make sure the popover is easily dismissible by clicking outside of it or pressing the escape key.
- Test the popover on different screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and accessible.

### Don't

- Don't use popovers for content that requires extensive scrolling or interaction.
- Don't overload the popover with too much information; keep it focused and to the point.
- Don't forget to consider accessibility; ensure the popover is keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.
