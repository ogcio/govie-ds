# Accessibility Standard

The government is committed to making its websites accessible in accordance with [S.I. 358/2020](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/358/made/en/print) and the [EU Web Accessibility Directive 2016/2102](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj).

A high level of accessibility is important to ensure everyone can avail of government services and find information regardless of their ability. Government sites strive to achieve, and be compliant with, [AA standard under the WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance).

Government sites are audited and regularly tested by the National Disability Authority (NDA).

The NDA is the independent statutory body that provides information and advice to the government on policy and practice relevant to the lives of people with disabilities.
