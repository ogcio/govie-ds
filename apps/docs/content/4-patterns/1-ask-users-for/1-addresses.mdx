# Addresses

This guidance is for government teams that build online services.

Help users provide an address using one of the following:

- Multiple text inputs
- Address lookup
- Textarea

### Default

<Image
  src="/addresses-pattern.png"
  alt="Line length example"
  width={650}
  height={300}
/>

### With Textarea

Use a textarea if you expect a broad range of address formats and you do not need to format the address for print or use specific sub-parts of the address (for example, street or postcode).

<Image
  src="/addresses-with-textarea-pattern.png"
  alt="Line length example"
  width={650}
  height={300}
/>
