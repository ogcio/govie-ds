# Patterns

Patterns are established solutions for common design challenges, helping to create consistent and intuitive user experiences. Each pattern addresses a specific design problem or interaction, such as form validation, user onboarding, or navigation flows. By leveraging these pre-defined patterns, user interfaces can be structured effectively, ensuring they adhere to design principles and provide a cohesive experience across all digital products.
