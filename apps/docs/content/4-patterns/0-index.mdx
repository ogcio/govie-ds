# Patterns

Patterns are established solutions for common design challenges, helping to create consistent and intuitive user experiences. Each pattern addresses a specific design problem or interaction, such as form validation, user onboarding, or navigation flows. By leveraging these predefined patterns, user interfaces can be structured effectively, ensuring they adhere to design principles and provide a cohesive experience across all digital products.
