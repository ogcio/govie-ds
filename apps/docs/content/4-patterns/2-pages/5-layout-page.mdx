## Overview

The layout system consists of various classes that allow you to structure your page in a flexible and responsive manner. These classes are essential for building grid-based layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and ensure content remains aligned and visually appealing.

Key concepts in the grid system include containers, grid layouts, and responsive behaviour. Containers define the overall width of the content, while grid layouts divide the content into columns. The responsive grids adapt to various screen sizes, adjusting the number of columns based on available space.

## Available Classes

### Containers

#### Standard Layout Container

A standard container with responsive padding and centring.

<pre>.gi-layout-container</pre>

#### Full Container Width

A full-width container with responsive padding for larger screens.

<pre>.gi-layout-container-full-width</pre>

### Grid Layouts

#### 12-Column Grid

Creates a 12-column grid with consistent spacing.

<pre>.gi-grid-12-column</pre>

#### 8-Column Grid

Defines an 8-column grid with moderate spacing.

<pre>.gi-grid-8-column</pre>

#### 4-Column Grid

Sets up a compact 4-column grid with smaller gaps.

<pre>.gi-grid-4-column</pre>

#### Responsive 12-Column Grid

A responsive grid that adjusts from 4 to 12 columns across screen sizes.
