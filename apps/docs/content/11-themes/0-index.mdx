# Themes

## Overview

In a design system, a **theme** is a defined set of stylistic tokens—such as colors, typography, spacing, and other visual attributes—that collectively determine the appearance of UI components. By encapsulating these stylistic elements into a theme, teams can consistently and efficiently adapt the user interface to different brands, or contextual requirements, without modifying the component structure.

## Benefits of Theming

Using themes provides several key benefits:

- **Consistency**: Maintains a uniform visual style across components and applications.
- **Flexibility**: Supports customization for different brands, regions, or user settings.
- **Efficiency**: Enables centralized style updates that propagate across the system.
- **Scalability**: Accommodates the addition of new themes without altering core components.

## Theme Integration Options

There are two primary methods for integrating themes into your project:

1. **Using the prebuilt `@govie-ds/theme-govie` package**
2. **Creating and exporting a custom theme with the Theme Builder**

  </TabList>

    The `@govie-ds/theme-govie` package provides a default theme with pre-configured design tokens. These tokens are exposed via the `meta` object and can be integrated with Tailwind CSS using the `createTheme` helper.

    ```ts
    // tailwind.config.js
    import { createTheme } from '@govie-ds/tailwind';
    import { meta } from '@govie-ds/theme-govie';

    const config: Config = {
      // Other Tailwind config...
      theme: createTheme({
        meta,
      }),
    };
    ```

    This setup allows you to use design system tokens directly within your Tailwind configuration.

    The Theme Builder provides a visual interface for generating custom themes. This method outputs a CSS file containing a `:root` block with your theme's CSS variables.

    #### Step 1: Generate and Download Theme

    1. Access the [Theme Builder](/themes/builder/)
    2. Customize your theme using the UI
    3. Click Download to export a `theme.css` file

    Example output:

    ```css
    :root {
      --gieds-color-primary-50: #f0fff7;
      --gieds-color-primary-100: #c2fde1;
      --gieds-color-primary-200: #95fbd0;
      --gieds-color-primary-300: #4aecb4;
      /* ...more tokens */
    }
    ```

    #### Step 2: Import Theme into Your Stylesheet

    Include the generated CSS file in your global stylesheet (e.g., `globals.css` or `main.css`):

    ```css
    @import './theme.css';
    ```
    This makes all the theme variables globally accessible within your application. This approach is ideal if you are not using the @govie-ds/theme-govie package or require customized, brand-specific themes.
