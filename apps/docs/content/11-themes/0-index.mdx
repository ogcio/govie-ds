# Themes

## Overview

In a design system, a **theme** is a defined set of stylistic tokens — such as colors, typography, spacing, and other visual attributes — that collectively determine the appearance of UI components. By encapsulating these stylistic elements into a theme, teams can consistently and efficiently adapt the user interface to different brands, or contextual requirements, without modifying the component structure.

## Benefits of Theming

Using themes provides several key benefits:

- **Consistency**: Maintains a uniform visual style across components and applications.
- **Flexibility**: Supports customization for different brands, regions, or user settings.
- **Efficiency**: Enables centralized style updates that propagate across the system.
- **Scalability**: Accommodates the addition of new themes without altering core components.

## Theme Integration Options

There are two primary methods for integrating themes into your project:

1. **Using the prebuilt `@ogcio/theme-govie` package**
2. **Creating and exporting a custom theme with the Theme Builder**

<Tabs id="themeTabs">
  <TabList>
    <TabItem value="themeTab1" checked>1. Prebuilt Theme</TabItem>
    <TabItem value="themeTab2">2. Custom Theme</TabItem>
  </TabList>

  <TabPanel value="themeTab1">
   The `@ogcio/theme-govie` package offers a default theme with pre-configured design tokens.
    To apply the **GOV IE** styles, import the `theme.css` file from the package at your application's entry point, for example:
    
    ```react
    import "@ogcio/design-system-react/styles.css";
    import "@ogcio/theme-govie/theme.css";

    export function App() {
      return (
        ...
      );
    }
    ```

        Note that you should typically run some form of CSS reset or normalisation of styles as part of your application entry point, depending on your application styling solution. For example Tailwind includes [preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight), an opinionated set of base styles.

    The Theme Builder provides a visual interface for generating custom themes. This method outputs a CSS file containing a `:root` block with your theme's CSS variables.

    #### Step 1: Generate and Download Theme

    1. Access the [Theme Builder](/themes/builder/)
    2. Customize your theme using the UI
    3. Click Download to export a `theme.css` file

    Example output:

    ```css
    :root {
      --gieds-color-primary-50: #f0fff7;
      --gieds-color-primary-100: #c2fde1;
      --gieds-color-primary-200: #95fbd0;
      --gieds-color-primary-300: #4aecb4;
      /* ...more tokens */
    }
    ```

    #### Step 2: Import Theme into Your Stylesheet

    Include the generated CSS file in your global stylesheet (e.g., `globals.css` or `main.css`):

    ```css
    @import './theme.css';
    ```
    This makes all the theme variables globally accessible within your application. This approach is ideal if you are not using the @ogcio/theme-govie package or require customized, brand-specific themes.
