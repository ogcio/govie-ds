# Governance and Maintainers

This repository is maintained by the Government of Ireland.

## Decision-making authority

Final decisions on:
- design patterns
- components
- content
- roadmap direction

rest with the designated maintainers.

This is an **open repository**, not an open decision-making body.

## Open source and authority

This design system is open source to encourage transparency and reuse.

However:
- Only official Irish government services may present themselves as such
- Only government-owned domains (e.g. `.gov.ie`) indicate authenticity
- Reuse of this repository does not imply endorsement or approval

Visual similarity alone does not confer legitimacy.

## Fraud and impersonation

Use of this design system to:
- impersonate government services
- mislead users
- falsely claim compliance or endorsement

may be unlawful.

The Government of Ireland reserves the right to:
- request takedown of misleading sites
- pursue legal remedies where appropriate

## Maintainers

Maintainers are appointed by the Government of Ireland.

They may:
- accept or reject contributions
- close issues or pull requests
- revise governance as needed.
