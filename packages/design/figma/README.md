## Using the Design System in Figma

### Import the library file

1. Download `GovIrelandDesignSystem.fig` from this repository  
2. In Figma, go to **File → Import**  
3. Select the `.fig` file  
4. Open the imported file in your Figma workspace

This creates a local copy of the Design System file in your space. **It will not update automatically when new versions are released.**




### Enable and use as a library

1. Open the imported Design System file  
2. Go to **Assets → Libraries**  
3. Enable the Design System library  
4. Open your own design file  
5. Insert components from the **Assets** panel



### Recommended usage

- Use components and styles directly from the Design System library  
- Keep components linked to the library to receive future updates within your file  
- When a new version is released, download and import the latest `.fig` file to update your local copy  

This helps keep designs consistent and makes updates easy to apply across teams.
