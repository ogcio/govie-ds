# Design System — Figma

This package ships the canonical Figma source for the Government of Ireland Design System. It includes the versioned `.fig` library file, supporting design assets/screenshots, and scripts/tooling used to generate and keep design tokens in sync between Figma and code.

Use this package to import or update the Design System library in Figma. It is not intended to be consumed by application or component code.
